                    <h4>Overcome the Language Barrier with Multilingual Translation Services from JR Language</h4>
                    <p>“It loses something in translation” is never an expression you will hear when working with JR Language. That’s because our multilingual translation professionals have first-hand experience in speaking, writing and understanding over 100 languages. Regardless of which language your document is in – or which language it will be translated into – the end result will read as though it were written by and for someone in your target culture.

                        We know that forging new, global business relationships and maintaining existing ones cannot be done without flexible, relevant, localized language solutions. You get that and more with JR Language Translations.</p>

                    <h4>Native, Foreign Language Translation Specialists</h4>
                    <p>In addition to merely speaking and writing the languages for which they translate, each of our foreign language translation specialists is a native speaker. Having lived and worked in regions where the target language is spoken, they fully understand the subtle idioms that are lost on other translators who rely on book knowledge rather than real-life experience.</p>

                    <p>An experienced translator who has experience in your industry will be hand-selected for your project. This expert will provide complete language solutions including reviewing your job, making suggestions and translating the documents to best communicate with the intended audience.</p>

                        CAT tools have many advantages that result in consistent translations, efficient turnaround times and, if you wish, we can even build up a customised
                        glossary for consistent use of particular terms. It requires fluency in at least 2 languages for any translator to confidently translate from one
                        language to another without missing the real meaning while maintaining the original content. It takes years to acquire such skill and is not everyone’s
                        cup of tea.
